## How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  Some new design skills I learned in OpenGL are creating planes and shape meshes, giving objects textures, and creating lighting.
  
### What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I first needed a reference for what I was creating, so this project was a picture I took at an IKEA furniture store. With this reference, half the work is done. The idea is already there and you just need to develop starting with the shapes, and then the color/textures, and lastly the lighting. Without the reference, there would be more work involved being sketching or drawing the idea out first to have some sort of reference.
  
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  The tactics I learned in OpenGL can be translated creatively and professionally. The truth is I am not a creative person, at all. Yet this course pushed my limits. I was in an uncomfortable zone for most of this as I am not artsy but I tried my best to push the vision I was going for. As far as professionalism, it has helped enforce some skills I think are stronger in my life, such as the mathematics side. I was able to see how matrices are applied at a level of programming allowing us to render shapes giving color and texture and how all this is possible if you do enough research and put enough effort to see how to do it. It was a fun experience. 
  
## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  As far as testing, static and dynamic testing need to be applied, my strategy was a little inverted compared to the conventional method. Usually, static testing comes before dynamic but I found it suitable in this situation to do it the other way around. For me, I changed the values in the code to whatever I was expecting and executed it to see if it came out as I would have imagined. Sometimes, it did sometimes it didn't. At that moment it didn't it is usually due to an issue in my code. I then know to go back and perform static testing because something is wrong with my script.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
  Since the modules split the work into iterations I was able to create each layer of the project first and receive feedback as I submitted each milestone. This allowed me to go back and modify and make changes and improvements without needing to wait until turning in the final project. This weekly feedback helped me give a better result and gave me a better understanding of what the requirements expected of me.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  I initially began from a blank canvas and scratch, everything was made from the inspiration of the original picture. As time moved on and the project began to look more like its final product I began to add more touches that allowed the scene of the room to look more full. This allowed me to be more creative, utilize the skills learned in the previous milestones, and expand on the project within the requirements.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Previously, I took a course on linear algebra and the second half of that course was all about matrices. It was very intense but toward the end, we saw a sneak peek of how matrices can be used to display and compress images. In this class, we went a whole step further, into the 3D scene and how matrices are used to create shape meshes, apply object textures, and even used in animation as well. I always knew that most of the advanced technology we use is developed and companies such as Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD all create products that specialize in the rapid computation of calculations to create exceptional rendering speed and quality.

###How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  There are multiple professional pathways that can utilize this skill. Game development, architectural rendering, and film making just to name a few. Most of these require a more creative type of person which I can admit that I am not, but the technical level of skill required is something I believe I can achieve and master if this is a route I would want to take. I really enjoyed the technical aspect of it and I have worked with many CAD programs before, I think this can layer smoothly with that to pursure a career in 3D modeling and rendering.
