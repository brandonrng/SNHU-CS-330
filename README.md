How do I approach designing software?
  I appraoch software design by using the software design lifecycle. First sstarting with understanding the requirements, drafting the idea using any form of psuedocode or UML, followed by development and testing and lastly maintence if required. With the constant invovlemnt of the client through out to give feedback on progress as well. For the contents of this class, a weekly demo of the 3D scene and functionality would be ideally what I would chose to do. I think it is important to organize all the steps into a backlog and go based off that, it will help to manage progress and give flexibilty.
  
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  Some new design skills I learned in OpenGL are creating pleanes and shape meshes, giving objects textures, and create lighting.
  
What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I first needed a reference of what I was creating, so for this project it was a picture I took at an IKEA furniture store. With this reference half the work is done. The idea is already there and you just need to develop starting with the shapes, and then the color/textures, and lastly the lighting. Without the reference, there would be more work involved being sketching or drawing the idea out first to have some sort of reference.
  
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  The tactics I learned in OpenGL can translate creativley and professionally. The truth is I am not a creative person, at all. Yet this course pushed my limits. I was in an uncomfortable zone for most of this as I am not artsy but I tried my best to push the vision I was going for. As far as professionalism, it has helped enforce some skills I think are stronger in my life, such as the mathematics side. I was able to see how matrices are applied to at a level of programming allowing tus to render shapes giving color and texture and how all this is possible if you do enough research and put enough effort to see how to do it. It was a fun experience. 
How do I approach developing programs?
  
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  As far as testing, static and dynamic testing need to be applied, my strategy was a little inverted compared to the conventional method. Usually static testing comes before dynamic but I found it suitable in this situation to do it the other way around. For me, I changed the values in the code to whatever I was expecting, and executed it to see if it came out as I would have imagined. Sometimes, it did sometimes it didn't. In those moment's it didn't it is usually due to an issue in my code. I then know to go back and perform static testing becuase something is wrong in my script.
